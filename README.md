## Building from Source

### Cross-Platform Package

To create a distributable package that works on any system with Python installed:

```bash
python build_package.py
```

This creates a ZIP file in the `dist` directory containing everything needed to run the game on any platform.

### Building Windows Executable on macOS

#### Using Docker

1. Install Docker Desktop for macOS
2. Run the build script:

```bash
./build_windows.sh
```

This will create a Windows executable (`DooMP-1.0-win64.exe`) in the `dist` directory.

#### Using Wine

1. Install Wine on macOS:

```bash
brew install --cask wine-stable
```

2. Run the Wine-based build script:

```bash
./build_windows_wine.sh
```

### Building macOS App

To build a native macOS application:

```bash
python deploy.py macos
```

This creates a `.app` bundle and `.dmg` file in the `dist` directory.

### Building Linux Executable

To build a Linux executable:

```bash
python deploy.py linux
```

This creates an executable and a `.tar.gz` archive in the `dist` directory.

### Building with GitHub Actions

This repository includes GitHub Actions workflows that automatically build game packages for all platforms.

To use it:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to the Actions tab in your repository
3. Run the "Build Game Packages" workflow manually or push to the main branch

## Development

### Requirements
